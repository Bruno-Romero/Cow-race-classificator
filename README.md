# Cow-race-classificator

The idea of the project is to make a tensorflow model which would recognize differents races of cows and if its race is pure or not (n+1 classes, n races and another one for not pure cows)

The notebook was made for two races but the idea is to upgrade it over time if it is able to create models with good performance.

About the dataset, you can find images of cows in internet of take it yourself if you have the opportunity, model was thought to be able to recognize cows that are in a especific angle because of the lack of data. If i get a nice dataset i'll probabbly upload it.
